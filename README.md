Event Management

Directions for map

Using the following plugins:

https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/event-post
https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/

Jo's suggestions:
- Move the menu bar to the footer. Could add a circular link in the top left to the footer but not sure this would be intuitive. You could make it a picture of a leopard tail.
- Make the [partners] text a readable colour.
- Set the logos of partners to link to partner web pages.
- Make the home page links work and the labels update from the calendar...and the other links on other pages too.
- Different picture for pop-ups page.
- Text overlay on menu photos.
- Contact page.
- Make spotless leopard logo in footer also a link to the home page.
- Pause button for video.





Notes 9-06

menu - just put a few main options and say follow us on facebook for regular updates
